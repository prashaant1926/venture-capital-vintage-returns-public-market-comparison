# Literature Review: Venture Capital Returns Across Vintages vs. Public Market Returns

## Research Context and Scope

This literature review examines the relationship between venture capital returns across different vintage years and their comparison to public market returns. The analysis spans foundational academic research from the 1990s through recent industry reports from 2024, covering methodological developments, empirical findings, and evolving market dynamics.

## Core Research Questions

1. How do venture capital returns vary across different vintage years?
2. What drives vintage year effects in VC performance?
3. How do VC returns compare to public market benchmarks across different time periods?
4. What methodological approaches best capture VC vs. public market performance differences?
5. How have these relationships evolved in recent market cycles?

## Methodological Foundation

### Performance Measurement Evolution

The field has evolved from simple return comparisons to sophisticated risk-adjusted methodologies. **Harris, Jenkinson & Kaplan (2020)** established the modern standard using institutional-quality cash flow data from Burgiss, covering nearly 1,400 U.S. private equity funds. Their work addressed critical selection bias issues that plagued earlier studies by using LP-reported rather than GP-reported data.

**Woodward & Hall (2003)** pioneered the construction of a comprehensive VC index using transaction-based valuations, creating the first S&P 500-equivalent benchmark for venture capital. Their repeat valuation methodology, adapted from real estate indices, provided the foundation for systematic VC performance tracking.

### Public Market Equivalent (PME) Methods

The development of PME methodologies represents a crucial advancement in comparing VC and public market returns. The **Kaplan-Schoar PME (2005)** established the basic framework, while subsequent refinements addressed technical limitations:

- **Long-Nickels PME (2007)**: Handled negative index returns
- **Direct Alpha PME (Gredil et al.)**: Added statistical rigor and confidence intervals
- **mPME (Cambridge Associates)**: Incorporated fund-specific characteristics

**Korteweg & Nagel (2013)** advanced the field significantly by developing a generalized Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF) approach that properly handles VC's irregular timing, skewness, and cross-sectional dependenceâ€”methodological challenges unique to private markets.

## Vintage Year Effects: Core Findings

### Empirical Evidence

Research consistently demonstrates strong vintage year effects in venture capital, with performance differences of 300-500 basis points between best and worst vintages. **Robinson & Sensoy (2011)** showed that public and private equity waves move together, creating systematic vintage year patterns.

**Key Vintage Year Patterns:**
- **Best Performers**: Post-recession vintages (1991-1993, 2002-2003, 2009-2010)
- **Worst Performers**: Peak market vintages (1999-2000, 2006-2007, 2020-2021)
- **Persistence**: Effects last throughout fund lifecycle, not just deployment period

### Mechanism Analysis

**Bernstein, Giroud & Townsend (2020)** identified three primary drivers of vintage year effects:

1. **Entry Valuation Effects**: Lower valuations during downturns create better entry prices
2. **Competition Dynamics**: Reduced competition during market stress improves deal terms
3. **Exit Environment**: Public market conditions during harvest period (years 5-8) significantly impact returns

The **"StepStone Vintage Year Power Law" (2023)** demonstrated that these effects follow a power law distribution, with extreme vintage years having disproportionate impact on long-term portfolio performance.

## Public Market Comparison: Evolving Understanding

### Aggregate Performance Analysis

**Empirical Consensus:**
- **Median VC Performance**: Approximately matches S&P 500 (PME ~1.0)
- **Top Quartile Premium**: Significant outperformance (PME 1.4-1.6)
- **Performance Dispersion**: Much wider than public markets (bottom quartile PME 0.6-0.8)

**Ouyang, Yu & Jagannathan (2020)** analyzed 17,242 ventures from 1980-2006, finding an aggregate IRR of 22% with a PME of 1.44. Critically, they showed that removing the top 5% of ventures turns the risk-adjusted return negative, highlighting the extreme concentration of VC returns.

### Risk Adjustment Developments

**Cochrane (2005)** fundamentally changed understanding by demonstrating that VC systematic risk is much higher than previously estimated. After proper risk adjustment, VC returns approximate market returns, with extreme positive skewness being a key differentiating factor.

Recent work by **MSCI (2024)** shows that replicating fundamental characteristics of private equity in public markets explains approximately 200 basis points of the 450 basis points of historical outperformance, with the remainder attributed to leverage effects, valuation smoothing, and potential alpha.

## Contemporary Challenges and Debates

### The "Private Market Premium" Controversy

**Lietz & Chvanov (2024)** question fundamental assumptions underlying PE's value proposition, noting that traditional premises are being challenged by recent data. They argue that superior returns vs. public markets are narrowing and liquidity premiums are not consistently justified.

**Sanati & Spyridopoulos (2024)** provide contrary evidence, showing that public markets allocate capital substantially more efficiently, with the efficiency gap concentrated in late-stage private deals that generate less innovation and revenue growth.

### Data Quality and Reporting Bias

**Smith & Smith (2023)** quantified systematic biases in VC performance reporting, finding that selective reporting by GPs overstates returns by approximately 4 percentage points. This finding has significant implications for historical vintage year performance comparisons.

## Recent Market Structure Changes

### Capital Concentration

**Carta Research (2025)** documents increasing concentration of VC dollars among fewer managers, with implications for vintage year analysis:
- Top-tier manager performance may diverge further from median
- Vintage effects may be amplified by manager concentration
- Access to top-performing managers becoming more restricted

### Exit Market Evolution

Industry reports from **McKinsey (2025)** and **Bain (2025)** highlight structural changes affecting vintage year performance:
- Longer holding periods due to challenging IPO markets
- Growth of continuation funds as primary exit mechanism
- Increased importance of operational value creation over financial engineering

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

### Identified Limitations

1. **Geographic Bias**: Most research focuses on U.S. markets, with limited analysis of international vintage effects
2. **Sector Granularity**: Insufficient analysis of how vintage effects vary by investment focus or industry sector
3. **Fund Characteristics**: Limited understanding of how vintage effects interact with fund size, strategy, or GP experience
4. **Modern Era Analysis**: Post-2008 dynamics may have changed fundamental vintage year relationships

### Emerging Research Areas

1. **ESG Integration**: How environmental, social, and governance considerations affect vintage year performance
2. **Technology Disruption**: Impact of AI, blockchain, and other technologies on traditional vintage patterns
3. **Global Market Integration**: How increasing market globalization affects regional vintage year effects
4. **Alternative Benchmarking**: Development of more sophisticated, dynamic benchmarking approaches

## Implications for Practice

### For Limited Partners

1. **Vintage Diversification**: Essential strategy given documented performance variation
2. **Counter-cyclical Investing**: Increasing allocations during market downturns can capture vintage year alpha
3. **Manager Selection**: Critical importance given performance dispersion wider than in public markets
4. **Long-term Perspective**: Vintage effects take 5-7 years to fully manifest

### For General Partners

1. **Market Timing Awareness**: Understanding of how entry timing affects portfolio construction
2. **Performance Attribution**: Clear communication of vintage year context in performance reporting
3. **Risk Management**: Recognition of systematic vintage year risks in portfolio management
4. **Value Creation Focus**: Emphasis on operational improvements given changing market dynamics

## Conclusion

The literature demonstrates clear evidence of significant vintage year effects in venture capital returns, with performance differences that persist throughout fund lifecycles. Comparison to public markets requires sophisticated methodological approaches that account for timing, risk, and selection bias effects.

The field continues to evolve, with recent research challenging some traditional assumptions about private market advantages while confirming the importance of manager selection and market timing. Future research must address geographic and sector limitations while incorporating changing market structures and new data sources.

**Key Insight for Future Research**: The interaction between vintage year effects and evolving market structures (concentration, regulation, technology) represents the most promising area for advancing understanding of VC performance relative to public markets.

## Points That Span Multiple Papers

1. **Vintage Year Effects Are Systematic**: Consistent evidence across methodologies and time periods
2. **Manager Selection Critical**: Performance dispersion much wider than public markets
3. **Risk Adjustment Essential**: Proper benchmarking requires sophisticated risk adjustment
4. **Data Quality Matters**: Selection bias and reporting issues significantly affect conclusions
5. **Market Structure Evolution**: Changing dynamics require updated analytical frameworks

This literature reveals a fundamental tension: while average VC returns may not consistently exceed public markets after proper risk adjustment, the potential for exceptional performance through vintage timing and manager selection remains significant. The challenge for both researchers and practitioners is developing frameworks that can identify and capture this performance potential while managing associated risks.
