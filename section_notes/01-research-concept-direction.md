# Research Concept & Direction

## Core Research Question
What are venture capital returns across different vintages and how does that compare to public market returns?

## Research Hypothesis Framework

### Established Priors (Literature-Level Assumptions)
Based on analysis of authoritative sources (NBER, Cambridge Associates, Preqin, J.P. Morgan):

1. **Static Comparison Assumption**: Most prior work compares VC and public markets using aggregate metrics without accounting for vintage-specific market entry conditions
2. **Risk-Adjusted Equivalence**: Literature assumes similar risk profiles when comparing IRR vs public market returns, despite fundamental structural differences
3. **Linear Performance Relationship**: Existing models treat VC performance as consistent across market cycles rather than cyclically dependent

### Novel Research Angles

#### Hypothesis 1: Market Cycle Dependency
**Claim**: VC funds initiated during public market downturns (bear market vintages) systematically outperform both bull market vintages and corresponding public market indices on a risk-adjusted basis.

**Prior Work Assumption**: Vintage year effects are treated as random variation rather than systematic patterns linked to broader market conditions.

**Novel Insight**: Entry valuations and deal competition vary systematically with public market cycles, creating predictable performance differentials.

#### Hypothesis 2: Temporal Risk Premium Decomposition  
**Claim**: The VC risk premium over public markets is non-stationary and correlates inversely with public market volatility regimes.

**Prior Work Assumption**: VC risk premiums are treated as constant across time periods.

**Novel Insight**: Risk premiums should adjust based on alternative investment availability and market uncertainty levels.

#### Hypothesis 3: Liquidity-Adjusted Performance Convergence
**Claim**: When adjusting for liquidity costs and opportunity costs of capital deployment timing, VC returns converge significantly closer to public market returns than traditional IRR comparisons suggest.

**Prior Work Assumption**: IRR comparisons adequately capture performance differences without accounting for capital deployment timing and liquidity constraints.

**Novel Insight**: True economic comparison requires modeling the cost of illiquidity and capital commitment timing.

## Testable Research Framework

### Evaluation Approach
1. **Quantitative Analysis**: Statistical testing of vintage performance patterns across market cycles
2. **Risk-Adjusted Metrics**: Development of liquidity-adjusted performance measures
3. **Empirical Validation**: Cross-validation using historical vintage data and public market benchmarks

### Expected Impact
This research challenges fundamental assumptions about how VC performance should be measured and compared, potentially reshaping:
- Investment allocation models for institutional investors
- VC fund marketing and performance reporting standards  
- Academic understanding of alternative asset risk premiums

### Implementation Scope
Focus on U.S. VC data (1995-2020) to ensure data quality and comparability, with potential extension to international markets for robustness testing.
