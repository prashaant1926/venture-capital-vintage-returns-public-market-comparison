{"id":"1","assumption":"Current approaches have limitations","hypothesis":"Venture capital funds from vintages following public market downturns generate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to both other vintages and public market indices due to lower entry valuations and reduced competition for deals.","impact":"Significant advancement in the field","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:21:00.747Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"2","assumption":"Vintage year effects are transitory and diminish over time","hypothesis":"Vintage year effects in venture capital persist throughout the entire fund lifecycle (7-10 years) and are not merely early-stage phenomena, fundamentally challenging the efficient market hypothesis in private markets.","impact":"Reshapes understanding of private market efficiency and timing effects","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"3","assumption":"VC performance can be adequately compared using simple benchmarks like S&P 500","hypothesis":"Meaningful VC-to-public market performance comparison requires multi-factor risk adjustment incorporating size, growth, leverage, and illiquidity factors, with traditional PME methods potentially understating or overstating true performance differences by 200-400 basis points.","impact":"Fundamental to proper asset allocation and performance evaluation","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"4","assumption":"VC performance data is generally reliable and unbiased","hypothesis":"Systematic reporting bias in VC performance data overstates historical returns by 300-500 basis points due to selective reporting by GPs and survivorship bias, requiring mandatory disclosure standards similar to public markets.","impact":"Questions validity of historical performance studies and policy frameworks","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"5","assumption":"Private markets allocate capital more efficiently than public markets","hypothesis":"Public markets demonstrate superior capital allocation efficiency compared to private markets, particularly in late-stage investments, due to better information transparency and governance mechanisms, challenging the fundamental premise for private market allocations.","impact":"Revolutionary change in understanding of market efficiency and institutional investment strategy","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"emerging"}
{"id":"6","assumption":"Top quartile VC performance is primarily driven by skill","hypothesis":"Extreme concentration of VC returns in the top 5% of investments suggests that exceptional performance is largely driven by exposure to fat-tail distributions rather than systematic skill, making top-quartile performance largely unpredictable ex-ante.","impact":"Challenges manager selection paradigms and fee structures in VC industry","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"supported"}
{"id":"7","assumption":"Recent market conditions haven't fundamentally changed VC dynamics","hypothesis":"The 2020-2021 'mega bubble' and subsequent high interest rate environment have created a structural break in vintage year patterns, making historical relationships between market conditions and VC performance less predictive for future vintages.","impact":"Requires new frameworks for vintage year analysis and LP allocation strategies","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"emerging"}
{"id":"8","assumption":"VC performance measurement methods are mature and settled","hypothesis":"Traditional performance measurement methods (IRR, PME) are inadequate for the modern VC landscape characterized by longer holding periods, continuation funds, and mark-to-market accounting, requiring new dynamic benchmarking approaches that account for changing exit patterns.","impact":"Necessitates new industry standards for performance measurement and comparison","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"emerging"}
{"id":"1","assumption":"VC outperformance is consistent across all vintage years","hypothesis":"Venture capital funds from vintages following public market downturns generate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to both other vintages and public market indices due to lower entry valuations and reduced competition for deals.","impact":"Would inform institutional asset allocation timing strategies and challenge conventional wisdom about consistent VC alpha","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:21:00.747Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"2","assumption":"Traditional IRR and MOIC adequately capture VC performance relative to public markets","hypothesis":"Public Market Equivalent (PME) and liquidity-adjusted metrics reveal that VC outperformance is concentrated in top-quartile funds and specific vintage cohorts, with median funds underperforming risk-adjusted public market benchmarks.","impact":"Would reshape how institutional investors evaluate VC allocations and benchmark performance","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:25:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"3","assumption":"VC performance persistence patterns remain stable over time","hypothesis":"Performance persistence in venture capital has systematically weakened post-2000 due to increased capital supply and competition, making vintage year timing more important than manager selection for return generation.","impact":"Would challenge fundamental assumptions about due diligence focus and selection criteria in VC investing","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:25:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"4","assumption":"Market timing effects in VC are random and unpredictable","hypothesis":"Systematic relationships exist between macroeconomic indicators at vintage formation (market volatility, interest rates, public market valuations) and subsequent VC fund performance relative to public markets.","impact":"Would enable development of quantitative models for optimal VC allocation timing","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
