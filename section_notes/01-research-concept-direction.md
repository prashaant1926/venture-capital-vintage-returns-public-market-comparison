# Research Concept & Direction: Venture Capital Vintage Returns vs Public Market Performance

## Research Question
What are venture capital returns across different vintages and how does that compare to public market returns?

## Research Context & Motivation

The venture capital industry has undergone significant structural changes over the past two decades, yet our understanding of vintage year performance dynamics relative to public markets remains incomplete. While early research (Kaplan & Schoar 2005) established performance persistence patterns, recent evidence suggests these dynamics have evolved as the industry has matured.

## Literature Review Synthesis

### Core Findings from Academic Research:

**1. Performance Persistence Evolution**
- Earlier studies found strong persistence in VC performance across successive funds
- Recent research (Harris, Jenkinson, Kaplan & Stucke 2020) shows persistence has weakened, particularly in buyout
- Persistence patterns differ significantly between VC and buyout strategies

**2. Vintage Year Effects**
- Fund performance varies dramatically by vintage year due to market timing
- Entry valuations and competitive dynamics at fund formation significantly impact returns
- Post-2000 data shows different patterns than pre-2000 studies

**3. Risk-Adjusted Performance Challenges**
- Traditional metrics (IRR, MOIC) inadequately capture risk and liquidity differences
- VC delivers higher nominal returns (~38% annualized) but with substantial risk (64% failure rates)
- Public markets offer lower but more consistent returns (~5.9% S&P 500) with daily liquidity

**4. Benchmarking Methodological Issues**
- Selection bias in self-reported data from early industry studies
- Public Market Equivalent (PME) and Direct Alpha provide better risk-adjusted comparisons
- Timing of cash flows creates significant measurement challenges

## Identified Research Gaps

### Gap 1: Systematic Vintage Timing Analysis
**Current State**: Research focuses on overall performance persistence but lacks systematic analysis of how macroeconomic conditions at vintage formation affect long-term performance relative to public markets.

### Gap 2: Risk-Adjusted Return Decomposition
**Current State**: Studies compare aggregate returns but don't decompose the sources of outperformance/underperformance across different market regimes and vintage cohorts.

### Gap 3: Liquidity-Adjusted Performance Metrics
**Current State**: Existing research doesn't adequately quantify the liquidity premium required to justify VC investment over public market alternatives across different vintage years.

## Proposed Research Hypotheses

### Core Research Direction
This research will test fundamental assumptions about venture capital vintage performance through a systematic analysis of risk-adjusted returns across different market conditions and vintage cohorts.

**Primary Research Vector**: The biggest risk dimension is whether vintage year timing effects can be systematically identified and quantified to inform asset allocation decisions.

### Research Methodology Framework
Following the literature-level hypothesis process:
1. **Establish priors**: VC outperforms public markets due to illiquidity premium and active management
2. **Test hypothesis**: Outperformance is concentrated in specific vintage cohorts following market dislocations
3. **Validate impact**: Results would inform institutional asset allocation and timing strategies

## Next Steps
1. Develop specific testable hypotheses for experimental validation
2. Identify appropriate datasets for empirical analysis
3. Design experiments to test core assumptions about vintage timing effects
