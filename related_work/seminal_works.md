# Seminal Works on Venture Capital Performance

## Key Foundational Papers

### 1. Harris, Jenkinson & Kaplan (2012, 2020) - "Private Equity Performance: What Do We Know?"

**Problem**: Lack of reliable, comprehensive data on private equity performance due to selection bias and reporting inconsistencies.

**Assumption in Prior Work**: Earlier studies relied on incomplete, self-reported data with significant selection bias toward better-performing funds.

**Insight**: Using Burgiss institutional-quality dataset, they provide first unbiased comprehensive view of PE performance across nearly 1,400 U.S. funds from 1984-2010.

**Technical Overview**: 
- Cash flow-based analysis using IRR and PME (Public Market Equivalent) methods
- Corrects for selection bias through institutional investor reporting
- Separates buyout and venture capital performance

**Key Findings**:
- Net-of-fees PE performance matches or slightly exceeds S&P 500
- VC funds show higher dispersion and stronger performance persistence
- Performance persistence stronger pre-2000 than post-2000
- Top quartile VC funds significantly outperform public markets

**Impact**: Established gold standard for PE performance measurement methodology. Most cited paper in private equity performance literature.

### 2. Woodward & Hall (2003) - "Benchmarking the Returns to Venture"

**Problem**: No reliable venture capital index comparable to S&P 500 for tracking VC performance over time.

**Assumption in Prior Work**: Prior VC performance studies lacked systematic approach to constructing market-wide index.

**Insight**: Created first comprehensive VC index using transaction-based valuations with econometric corrections for selection bias.

**Technical Overview**:
- Used repeat valuation model similar to real estate indices
- Built from 50,734 funding events across 9,092 firms over 17 years
- Corrected for selection bias in reporting

**Key Findings**:
- VC returns highly volatile and cyclical
- Significant vintage year effects driven by market conditions at time of investment
- Risk-adjusted VC performance varies substantially over time

**Impact**: Provided foundation for VC index construction and performance benchmarking. Widely used by institutional investors for portfolio allocation decisions.

### 3. Cochrane (2005) - "The Risk and Return of Venture Capital"

**Problem**: Understanding true risk-adjusted returns of venture capital given highly skewed distribution of outcomes.

**Assumption in Prior Work**: Prior work underestimated systematic risk in VC due to focus on individual company rather than portfolio-level returns.

**Insight**: VC returns exhibit extremely high systematic risk that must be accounted for in performance evaluation.

**Technical Overview**:
- Used portfolio-level analysis with CAPM and multifactor models
- Corrected for selection bias and survivorship bias
- Analyzed risk-return profile at aggregate level

**Key Findings**:
- VC systematic risk much higher than previously estimated
- Risk-adjusted VC returns close to market returns after proper risk adjustment
- Extreme positive skewness in returns distribution critical for understanding VC

**Impact**: Fundamentally changed understanding of VC risk-return characteristics. Influenced asset allocation models for institutional investors.

### 4. Korteweg & Nagel (2013) - "Risk-Adjusting the Returns to Venture Capital"

**Problem**: Existing performance evaluation methods inadequate for VC given irregular, skewed payoffs and endogenous timing.

**Assumption in Prior Work**: Standard PME methods make restrictive assumptions about risk that may not hold for VC.

**Insight**: Developed generalized SDF (Stochastic Discount Factor) approach that handles VC-specific characteristics.

**Technical Overview**:
- Extended PME methodology using generalized SDF framework
- Handles irregular timing, skewness, and cross-sectional dependence
- Separates fund-level vs. company-level performance

**Key Findings**:
- VC start-up investments earn substantial positive abnormal returns
- VC fund abnormal returns close to zero after fees
- Confirms importance of manager selection in VC

**Impact**: Provides most rigorous framework for VC performance evaluation. Widely adopted by academic researchers and practitioners.

## Common Themes Across Seminal Works

1. **Data Quality Critical**: All seminal works emphasize importance of high-quality, unbiased data sources
2. **Vintage Year Effects**: Strong consensus that vintage year timing significantly impacts returns
3. **Risk Adjustment Essential**: Proper risk adjustment crucial for meaningful performance evaluation
4. **Manager Selection Matters**: Performance dispersion much wider in VC than public markets
5. **Methodological Innovation**: Each work contributed new methodological approaches to handle VC-specific challenges

## Research Gaps Identified

1. **International Comparisons**: Most work focuses on U.S. markets
2. **Sector-Specific Analysis**: Limited analysis of vintage effects by industry sector
3. **Market Cycle Interactions**: Need better understanding of how vintage effects interact with broader market cycles
4. **Alternative Benchmarks**: Beyond S&P 500, what are appropriate public market benchmarks?
