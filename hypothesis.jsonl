{"id":"1","assumption":"VC outperformance is consistent across all vintage years","hypothesis":"Venture capital funds from vintages following public market downturns generate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to both other vintages and public market indices due to lower entry valuations and reduced competition for deals.","impact":"Would inform institutional asset allocation timing strategies and challenge conventional wisdom about consistent VC alpha","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:21:00.747Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"2","assumption":"Traditional IRR and MOIC adequately capture VC performance relative to public markets","hypothesis":"Public Market Equivalent (PME) and liquidity-adjusted metrics reveal that VC outperformance is concentrated in top-quartile funds and specific vintage cohorts, with median funds underperforming risk-adjusted public market benchmarks.","impact":"Would reshape how institutional investors evaluate VC allocations and benchmark performance","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:25:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"3","assumption":"VC performance persistence patterns remain stable over time","hypothesis":"Performance persistence in venture capital has systematically weakened post-2000 due to increased capital supply and competition, making vintage year timing more important than manager selection for return generation.","impact":"Would challenge fundamental assumptions about due diligence focus and selection criteria in VC investing","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:25:30.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"4","assumption":"Market timing effects in VC are random and unpredictable","hypothesis":"Systematic relationships exist between macroeconomic indicators at vintage formation (market volatility, interest rates, public market valuations) and subsequent VC fund performance relative to public markets.","impact":"Would enable development of quantitative models for optimal VC allocation timing","timestamp":"2025-10-08T01:26:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
